# BookFinder
an ES6 and react application

<br>

Hey there,
 
 This repo contains a web application which helps the user find the book that he/she wants. It uses Google Book API to get info about the books. Also, I've used React and ES6 for development.

### Working..

The user enters text in the search field of the application and then the application shows a list of 10 books that is relevant to the entered search text.

### To get started

6. open browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the project.
